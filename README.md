# MasterSchedulizer

MasterSchedulizer serves to streamline the process of creating a plan of study, as well as to allow users to keep track of requirements and electives. Given a user’s major(s) and minor(s), MasterSchedulizer creates a generic template which outlines a full college plan. The user can then add tracks, minors, electives, and other classes of interest. MasterSchedulizer will also track requirements and make sure that the plan of study doesn’t violate university policy and is possible in the given timeframe (all courses must be available in the chosen term, etc.).

If integrated into Drexel’s systems MasterSchedulizer would allow advisors to track advisees with greater ease. Heads of departments could also track the number of students who are taking a specific course in any given quarter giving a better estimate of the needed sections.

The system expects input in three forms. The first is numerical input from the user for selecting menu options through the terminal interface. The second is a typed file path from the user specifying where their saved plan of study if a previous plan of study exists in the correct CSV format. The third input that the system expects is the CSV file itself to load information from a previous session.

The user will see his/her optimized Plan of Study printed out on the command line, with the option to download to a CSV file. All output messages will be printed to the terminal interface.
